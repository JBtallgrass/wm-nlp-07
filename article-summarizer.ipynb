      "\n",
      "something better, and we may consider that there is a future before\n",

      "drill for myself, and some gowns for you.\" You would not let\n",
      "\n",
      "me sell any of my dresses, and I have half a dozen light ones. In the\n",

      "\n",
      "corner; and we will celebrate my appointment with a cold chicken,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a bottle of port. We are going out at the best\n",
      "\n",
      "time of the year, and it will be a comfort, indeed, to change these\n",
      "\n",
      "November fogs for the sunshine of Egypt. You will have four or five\n",
      "\n",
      "months to get strong again, before it begins to be hot. Even in\n",
      "\n",
      "summer, there are cool breezes morning and evening; and of course,\n",
      "\n",
      "no one thinks of going out in the middle of the day. I feel as\n",
      "\n",
      "happy as a schoolboy, at the thought of getting out of this den and\n",
      "\n",
      "this miserable climate, and of basking in the sunshine. But it has\n",
      "\n",
      "been a trial, when your manuscripts have come back, to see you\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting here slaving away; and to know that it is I who have\n",
      "\n",
      "brought you to this.\" If a man chooses a path for himself, he must not\n",
      "\n",
      "grumble because he finds it rather rougher than he expected. I have\n",
      "\n",
      "never, for a single moment, regretted what I have done; at any\n",

      "\n",
      "cheerful as to cause one regret, at leaving it.\" And so, Gregory Hartley and his wife went out to Alexandria, and\n",
      "\n",
      "established themselves in three bright rooms, in the upper part of\n",
      "\n",
      "a house that commanded a view of the port, and the sea beyond it. The outlay required for furniture was small, indeed: some matting\n",
      "\n",
      "for the floors, a few cushions for the divans which ran round the\n",
      "\n",
      "rooms, a bed, a few simple cooking utensils, and a small stock of\n",
      "\n",
      "crockery sufficed. Mr. Ferguson, the manager of the branch, had at first read the\n",
      "\n",
      "letter that Gregory had brought him with some doubt in his mind, as\n",
      "\n",
      "to the wisdom of his principal, in sending out a man who was\n",
      "\n",
      "evidently a gentleman. This feeling, however, soon wore away; and\n",
      "\n",
      "he found him perfectly ready to undertake any work to which he was\n",
      "\n",
      "set. He\n",
      "\n",
      "was at the office early, and saw that the native swept and dusted\n",
      "\n",
      "the offices. The rest of the day he was either in the warehouse, or\n",
      "\n",
      "carried messages, and generally did such odd jobs as were required. A fortnight after his arrival, one of the clerks was kept away by a\n",
      "\n",
      "sharp attack of fever; and as work was pressing, the agent asked\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregory to take his place. Mr. Hardman will take Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parrot's ledgers; and, as you will only have to copy the\n",
      "\n",
      "storekeeper's issues into the books, five minutes will show you the\n",
      "\n",
      "form in which they are entered.\" Gregory gave such satisfaction that he was afterwards employed\n",
      "\n",
      "at office work, whenever there was any pressure. He had, before leaving England, signed a contract to remain with\n",
      "\n",
      "the firm for two years. He regretted having to do this, as it\n",
      "\n",
      "prevented his accepting any better position, should an opening\n",
      "\n",
      "occur; but he recognized that the condition was a fair one, after\n",
      "\n",
      "the firm paying for his outfit and for two passages. \"I don't mind my work a bit,\" he said to his wife, \"but, if only\n",
      "\n",
      "for the sake of the boy\" (a son had been born, a few months after\n",
      "\n",
      "their arrival), \"I must try to raise myself in the scale, a bit. From\n",
      "\n",
      "what the manager said to me the other day, if a vacancy occurred in\n",
      "\n",
      "the office, I should have the offer of the berth. Of course, it\n",
      "\n",
      "would be a step; for I know, from the books, that Hardman gets two\n",
      "\n",
      "hundred a year, which is forty more than I do.\" It troubles\n",
      "\n",
      "me, to think that half your time is spent packing up goods in the\n",
      "\n",
      "warehouse, and work of that sort; and even if we got less I would\n",
      "\n",
      "much rather, even if we had to stint ourselves, that your work was\n",
      "\n",
      "more suitable to your past; and such that you could associate again\n",
      "\n",
      "with gentlemen, on even terms.\" \"That does not trouble me, dear, except that I wish you had some\n",
      "\n",
      "society among ladies. However, both for your sake and the boy's,\n",
      "\n",
      "and I own I should like it myself, I will certainly keep on the\n",
      "\n",
      "lookout for some better position. I have often regretted, now, that\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not go in for a commission in the army. By this time, with luck, I might have\n",
      "\n",
      "got my company; and though the pay would not have been more than I\n",
      "\n",
      "get here, it would, with quarters and so on, have been as much, and\n",
      "\n",
      "we should be in a very different social position. \"However, it is of no use talking about that now; and indeed, it\n",
      "\n",
      "is difficult to make plans at all. Things are in such an unsettled\n",
      "\n",
      "condition, here, that there is no saying what will happen. Tewfik has been obliged to make concession after concession\n",
      "\n",
      "to them, to dismiss ministers at their orders, and to submit to a\n",
      "\n",
      "series of humiliations. At any moment, Arabi could dethrone him, as\n",
      "\n",
      "he has the whole army at his back, and certainly the larger portion\n",
      "\n",
      "of the population. The revolution could be completed without\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble or bloodshed; but you see, it is complicated by the fact\n",
      "\n",
      "that Tewfik has the support of the English and French governments;\n",
      "\n",
      "and there can be little doubt that the populace regard the movement\n",
      "\n",
      "as a national one, and directed as much against foreign control and\n",
      "\n",
      "interference as against Tewfik, against whom they have no ground of\n",
      "\n",
      "complaint, whatever. On the part of the army and its generals, the\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble has arisen solely on account of the favouritism shown to\n",
      "\n",
      "Circassian officers. Attacks have been made upon these in various country\n",
      "\n",
      "districts; and, should Arabi be triumphant, the position of\n",
      "\n",
      "Christians will become very precarious. Matters are evidently seen\n",
      "\n",
      "in that light in England; for I heard today, at the office, that\n",
      "\n",
      "the British and French squadrons are expected here, in a day or\n",
      "\n",
      "two. But I should hardly think that Arabi would venture to\n",
      "\n",
      "try his strength against that of the fleets, and I fancy that\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble will, in the first place, begin in Cairo; both as being the\n",
      "\n",
      "capital of the country, and beyond the reach of armed interference\n",
      "\n",
      "by the Powers. Arabi's natural course would be to consolidate his\n",

      "power throughout the whole of Egypt, leaving Alexandria severely\n",

      "one of the ships lying in harbour. As a simple measure of\n",
      "\n",
      "precaution, I would suggest that you should go out with me, this\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "is only a long blue robe, enveloping you from head to foot; and one\n",
      "\n",
      "of those hideous white cotton veils, falling from below the eyes. I\n",
      "\n",
      "will get a bottle of iodine, and you will then only have to darken\n",

      "for an hour or two, I will see what can be done.\" Mr. Murray, as they went out together, said: \"I think that you have made a good impression. He told me,\n",
      "\n",
      "before, that it was a matter for Sir Herbert Kitchener, and that he\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "as Sir Herbert Kitchener, whose figure was well known in Cairo,\n",
      "\n",
      "passed through the room; all who were sitting there rising to their\n",

      "feet, as he did so. His keen glance seemed,\n",
      "\n",
      "to Gregory, to take him in from head to foot, and then to look at\n",
      "\n",
      "something far beyond him. Though I would rather not be on the railway, for the\n",
      "\n",
      "railway cannot get on as fast as the troops; but I would enlist in\n",
      "\n",
      "one of the English regiments, if they would take me.\" \"Yes; I do not think I speak it quite as well as Arabic, but I\n",
      "\n",
      "speak it fairly.\" I have been accustomed\n",
      "\n",
      "to take long walks, and spend an hour a day in gymnastic exercises,\n",

      "\n",
      "the men who unloaded the trucks, the labourers who did the earth\n",

      "\n",
      "laid them down roughly in position; others followed, and corrected\n",

      "the distance between each. The rails were then brought along and\n",
      "\n",
      "laid down, with the fish plates, in the proper places; men put\n",

      "thrown in and packed down between the sleepers. By this division of labour, the line was pushed on from one to\n",

      "and everything worked with as much regularity as in a great factory\n",

      "\n",
      "so as to prevent any bands of Dervishes from dashing suddenly down\n",

      "\n",
      "marching quietly and silently; and, at half-past four, deployed\n",
      "\n",
      "into line close to the enemy's position. A few minutes later the\n",
      "\n",
      "alarm was given; and the Dervishes, leaping to arms, discovered\n",

      "that their retreat was cut off, by another large body of troops in\n",

      "\n",
      "it was glorious, as we outnumbered them by three to one. Still, it\n",
      "\n",
      "was a heavy blow to the Dervishes, and the fact that the Khalifa\n",
      "\n",
      "was obliged to send troops down to the Nile, to check an advance\n",
      "\n",
      "that had proved so formidable, must have greatly relieved the\n",

      "opposite the enemy's lines. Four batteries, and the Maxims, at once\n",
      "\n",
      "moved over, with two companies of Soudanese, and opened fire. The\n",
      "\n",
      "distance across was but six hundred yards, and the fire was\n",

      "tremendous--shell, shrapnel, and rockets--while the Soudanese fired\n",

      "treated, will go through fire and water for their master. \"Go down to the stores, and tell the officer in charge there\n",

      "clearly incapable of doing his share in carrying the heavy bales\n",

      "very faithful, and if you do not find me willing to do all that you\n",
      "\n",
      "tell me, you can send me back to work here.\" And, followed by the young tribesman, he went to the\n",

      "of that sort, from one of the natives here? He then walked down to the river, and found the black corporal\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting tranquilly by the side of his baggage. The man stood up and\n",
      "\n",
      "saluted, and on Gregory saying that he had now a house, at once\n",
      "\n",
      "told off two soldiers to carry the things. Arriving at the hut, he found Zaki hard at work, shovelling the\n",
      "\n",
      "rubbish through the doorway. Just as he came up, the boy brought\n",
      "\n",
      "down his tool, with a crash, upon a little brown creature that was\n",
      "\n",
      "scuttling away. When you have got\n",
      "\n",
      "the rubbish out, make a fire in the middle, wet some leaves and\n",
      "\n",
      "things and put them on, and we will hang a blanket over the window\n",

      "\n",
      "tightly, the cracks were filled with some damp earth from the\n",
      "\n",
      "watercourse. There is a sauce pan and a kettle, so you can boil some rice or fry\n",
      "\n",
      "some meat.\" The troops were in little\n",
      "\n",
      "mud huts, of their own construction; as these, in the heat of the\n",

      "\n",
      "Soudanese troops were all occupied in cooking, mending their\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes, sweeping the streets between the rows of huts, and other\n",
      "\n",
      "light duties. They seemed, to Gregory, as full of fun and life as a\n",
      "\n",
      "party of schoolboys--laughing, joking, and playing practical tricks\n",
      "\n",
      "on each other. The physique of some of the regiments was splendid, the men\n",
      "\n",
      "averaging over six feet in height, and being splendidly built. Other regiments, recruited among different tribes, were not so\n",
      "\n",
      "tall, but their sturdy figures showed them to be capable of any\n",
      "\n",
      "effort they might be called upon to make. I am not attached to any regiment; but, as I speak the\n",
      "\n",
      "languages well, General Hunter is going, so he said, to make me\n",
      "\n",
      "generally useful. You can tell me the last news from Cairo, and when we\n",
      "\n",
      "are going to move.\" \"I shall be happy to come in and have a chat,\" Gregory said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but I do not drink anything. I have been brought up in Cairo, and\n",
      "\n",
      "am accustomed to heat, and I find that drinking only makes one more\n",

      "thirsty.\" \"I believe it does,\" the other said, \"especially when the liquid\n",

      "is almost as hot as one is, one's self. \"Nothing; but the officers I have spoken to all seem to think\n",

      "would still have preferred his own, as they were accustomed to each\n",

      "expression of the officers' faces, that they all were aware of the\n",
      "\n",
      "reason for his absence. One after another they either shook hands\n",

      "\n",
      "\"Take care of yourself, lad,\" or \"A safe journey and a speedy\n",

      "up to his ears; so that the white, closely-fitting cap would\n",
      "\n",
      "completely cover the hair. Outside the tent a sauce pan was boiling\n",
      "\n",
      "with herbs and berries, which the lad had procured from an old\n",

      "\n",
      "which were to be sewn on at their first halting place. The man called up the native sergeant from the guard tent, who\n",
      "\n",
      "asked what he wanted. \"I suppose it is you, Hilliard,\" he said, \"but I certainly\n",

      "halted, watered their horses and, after giving them a good feed,\n",
      "\n",
      "turned them out to munch the shrubs or graze on the grass, as they\n",

      "afterwards sewed the Mahdi patches upon their clothes. When the sun went down they fetched the horses in, gave them a\n",

      "\n",
      "was plenty of water in the wells, they took an empty gourd down\n",
      "\n",
      "and, stripping, poured water over their heads and bodies; then,\n",

      "feeling greatly refreshed, dressed and lay down to sleep. The moon rose between twelve and one; and, after giving the\n",

      "\n",
      "soon after daybreak. They had stopped a mile away, and Zaki went\n",
      "\n",
      "forward on foot, hiding himself as much as possible from\n",
      "\n",
      "observation. On his return he reported that no one was at the\n",

      "\n",
      "surprise. The character of the scenery had completely changed; and they\n",
      "\n",
      "had, for some miles, been winding along at the foot of the\n",

      "\n",
      "were; and as there are no others this side of Abu Klea, I should\n",

      "have had rather a bad day.\" The three forts which the Guards had built, when they came on in\n",
      "\n",
      "advance of General Stewart's column, were still standing; as well\n",
      "\n",
      "as a number of smaller ones, which had been afterwards added. \"It is rather a bad place for being caught, Zaki, for the ground\n",

      "I said, there must be wells, and even if they are dry, we may be\n",
      "\n",
      "able to scratch the sand out and find a little water. \"That is a poor supply for two days, Zaki, but we must make the\n",
      "\n",
      "best of them. We will only eat a few today, so as to have a fair\n",
      "\n",
      "meal in the morning. \"It will not be all sand,\" Zaki said; \"there is grass for the\n",

      "last fifteen miles, near the river; and there were cultivated\n",

      "fields about ten miles out, before the Dervishes came.\" The herbage the horses had cropped during the halt had served,\n",
      "\n",
      "to a certain degree, to supply the place of water; and they\n",

      "proceeded at a brisker pace than Gregory had expected. Even if the wells are dry, you\n",

      "\n",
      "as it is certain that this route has not been used for some time,\n",
      "\n",
      "there may even be grass.\" They rode on at an easy canter, and avoided pressing the horses\n",
      "\n",
      "in the slightest degree, allowing them to walk whenever they chose. \"I think this must be one of the old halting places,\" Zaki said,\n",

      "them looked a somewhat darker colour than the others. The bottom of the hole was some six feet across, and they set to\n",
      "\n",
      "work in the middle of it. \"We will get to water, Zaki, if we have to stay here all day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "said Gregory. It was hard work, and it was not until after four hours' toil\n",
      "\n",
      "that, to their delight, they found the sand wet under their feet. They had taken it by turns to use the scoop, for the labour of\n",
      "\n",
      "making the hole large enough for them both to work at once would\n",
      "\n",
      "have been excessive. Gregory took a gourd, and buried it in the soft soil until the\n",
      "\n",
      "water flowed in over the brim. The scoops were\n",
      "\n",
      "then refilled and carried to the horses, who drank with an\n",
      "\n",
      "eagerness that showed how great was their thirst. This was half filled, and then, exhausted with their work, they\n",
      "\n",
      "threw themselves down and slept for some hours. \"We are safe now, and only have to fear a band of marauding\n",

      "\n",
      "their usual pace, of their own accord. \"The horses will keep to it, my lord,\" he said; \"their sight is\n",
      "\n",
      "a great deal better than ours, and I dare say their smell may have\n",
      "\n",
      "something to do with it. Besides, the track is clear of bushes, so\n",

      "another handful of dates, and give the horses a handful each, and\n",

      "that will leave us a few for the morning.\" The horses, after being given the dates, were again turned\n",
      "\n",
      "loose; and it was not long before they were heard pulling the\n",
      "\n",
      "leaves off bushes. \"Then it looked as if it would be rather\n",
      "\n",
      "a close thing, for I am sure the horses could not have gone much\n",
      "\n",
      "farther, if we had not found the water. They get little\n",
      "\n",
      "else, when they are with the Arabs; a handful of durra,\n",
      "\n",
      "occasionally, when they are at work; but at other times they only\n",
      "\n",
      "get what they can pick up. They ate the remainder of their dates, took a drink of water,\n",
      "\n",
      "and gave two gourdfuls to the horses; and, in a quarter of an hour,\n",
      "\n",
      "were on their way again. As far as I can see, only four of them have guns; the others\n",
      "\n",
      "have spears. With my breech-loader I can fire\n",
      "\n",
      "two shots to their one, and we have pistols, as well.\" The Arabs drew up ahead of them, and remained quiet there until\n",
      "\n",
      "the others came to within fifty yards, and checked their horses. A\n",
      "\n",
      "man who appeared to be the leader of the party shouted the usual\n",
      "\n",
      "salutation, to which Gregory replied. Then he said to Zaki, \"Dismount and stand behind your horse, and\n",

      "fire over the saddle; but don't fire the first shot now.\" Scarcely had he done so when\n",
      "\n",
      "four shots were fired, and Gregory took a steady aim at the chief. Zaki did not fire until they were within\n",
      "\n",
      "twenty yards, and directly afterwards Gregory fired again. He then saw why Zaki had not fired when he first did so--his\n",

      "before. \"Just see if they have got some dates on their saddles,\" for the\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "these four guns, and carry the barrels off, and throw them into the\n",
      "\n",
      "bushes, a mile or two away.\" They halted\n",
      "\n",
      "in a quarter of an hour and, after Gregory's arm had been bound\n",
      "\n",
      "tightly to his side with his sash, both they and their horses had a\n",
      "\n",
      "good meal of dates. There was a slight stir as they were seen coming, and a dozen\n",
      "\n",
      "black soldiers sprang up and ran forward, fixing bayonets as they\n",
      "\n",
      "did so. They knew that the Dervishes were sometimes ready to throw away\n",
      "\n",
      "their own lives, if they could but kill some of their enemy. He went back to the tents, and returned with a white officer,\n",
      "\n",
      "whom Gregory at once recognized as one of those who had come up\n",
      "\n",
      "with him from Wady Halfa. The officer had stopped in astonishment, at hearing this seeming\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervish address him, by name, in English. The next thing we need is something to eat;\n",
      "\n",
      "for the last three days we have had nothing but dates, and not too\n",
      "\n",
      "many of them. When the ball had been extracted from his shoulder, and the\n",
      "\n",
      "wound dressed and bandaged by the surgeon in charge, Gregory went\n",
      "\n",
      "up to the tents again, where he was warmly received by the three\n",
      "\n",
      "white officers of the Negro regiment. After\n",
      "\n",
      "having made a hearty meal, Gregory related the adventure with the\n",
      "\n",
      "Arabs in the desert, merely saying that they had found there were\n",
      "\n",
      "no Dervishes at Gakdul. \"I wanted to see whether this line was open, and whether there\n",
      "\n",
      "were any wells on it. We only found one, and it took us four or\n",
      "\n",
      "five hours' hard work to get at the water. It is lucky, indeed,\n",
      "\n",
      "that we did so; for our horses were getting very done up, and I had\n",
      "\n",
      "begun to think that they would not reach our destination\n",
      "\n",
      "alive.\" In the afternoon, the adventurers started with the boats going\n",
      "\n",
      "up to Merawi and, the next morning, arrived at the camp. The\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervish patches had been removed from their clothes, as soon as\n",
      "\n",
      "they arrived at Ambukol. Gregory could have borrowed a white suit\n",
      "\n",
      "there; but as the stain on his skin, although somewhat lighter than\n",
      "\n",
      "when first put on, was too dark, he declined the offer. \"No one may notice me as I land, now,\" he said, \"but everyone\n",
      "\n",
      "would stare at a man with a brown face and white uniform.\" Leaving Zaki to get the horses on shore, Gregory went straight\n",
      "\n",
      "to the General's quarters. \"If you send in word to him that his messenger has returned, I\n",
      "\n",
      "am sure he will see me.\" Gregory, however, was in no humour to be stopped; and in an\n",
      "\n",
      "authoritative voice called, \"Orderly!\" As the General had seen Gregory in his disguise, before\n",
      "\n",
      "starting, he of course recognized him. \"My dear Hilliard,\" he said, getting up and shaking him\n",
      "\n",
      "cordially by the hand, \"I am heartily glad to see you back. You\n",
      "\n",
      "have been frequently in my thoughts; and though I had every\n",
      "\n",
      "confidence in your sharpness, I have regretted, more than once,\n",
      "\n",
      "that I allowed you to go. I suppose, when you got to\n",
      "\n",
      "Gakdul, you learned that the Dervishes were at Abu Klea.\" \"They were at Abu Klea, General; but I made a detour, and got\n",
      "\n",
      "into their camp at Metemmeh.\" \"I told you, Macdonald,\" he said, turning to the officer with\n",
      "\n",
      "whom he had been engaged, \"that I had the greatest hope that Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hilliard would get through. He felt so confident in himself that I\n",
      "\n",
      "could scarce help feeling confidence in him, too.\" \"I should\n",
      "\n",
      "not have liked to send any of my officers on such an adventure,\n",
      "\n",
      "though they have been here for years.\" \"Well, will you sit down, Mr. Hilliard,\" the General said, \"and\n",
      "\n",
      "give us a full account? Gregory related the conversations he had heard among the\n",
      "\n",
      "soldiers; and then that of Mahmud's brother and the commander of\n",
      "\n",

      "finally reached the Egyptian camp. \"You have certainly had some narrow escapes, and seem to have\n",

      "telegraph, at once, to the Sirdar that there will assuredly be no\n",

      "free to carry out the plans he has formed. I shall of course, in my\n",

      "I have obtained that information.\" \"You will make your way, Mr. Hilliard--that is, if you don't try\n",
      "\n",
      "this sort of thing again. A man may get through it once, but it\n",
      "\n",
      "would be just tempting providence to try it a second time.\" You\n",

      "must keep quiet, and do no more duty until you are discharged from\n",

      "Macdonald; consisting of the 3rd Egyptians, and the 9th, 10th, and\n",

      "the next day to Kassinger, the advanced post some ten miles higher\n",
      "\n",
      "up the river. This seemed only a preliminary step, and the general\n",
      "\n",
      "opinion was that another fortnight would elapse before there would\n",
      "\n",
      "be a general movement. A reconnaissance with friendly Arabs had, however, been made\n",
      "\n",
      "ahead towards Abu Hamed, and had obtained certain information that\n",
      "\n",
      "the garrison at that place was by no means a strong one. The\n",
      "\n",
      "information Gregory had gathered had shown that Mahmud had no\n",

      "intention of advancing against Merawi; and that no reinforcements\n",

      "\n",
      "admit of boats going up the cataract. Thus, everything favoured the Sirdar's plan to capture Abu\n",

      "before Mahmud could receive the news that the troops were in\n",
      "\n",
      "motion. He therefore directed General Hunter to push forward, with\n",
      "\n",
      "only one brigade, leaving the rest to hold Merawi; and ordered the\n",
      "\n",
      "camel corps, and the friendly Arabs, to advance across the desert\n",
      "\n",
      "as far as the Gakdul wells, where their appearance would lead\n",
      "\n",
      "Mahmud to believe that they were the advance guard of the coming\n",

      "army. Two days later Gregory, on going to the headquarters tent, was\n",
      "\n",
      "told that General Hunter and his staff would start, in an hour's\n",
      "\n",
      "time, to inspect the camp at Kassinger. The doctor discharged me yesterday as fit for\n",

      "duty, but advised me to keep my arm in a sling, for a time.\" \"It is a little uncertain when we shall return,\" the officer\n",
      "\n",
      "said, with a smile; \"therefore I advise you to take all your\n",

      "can go on with the camel.\" Behind the headquarter camp the work of packing up was also\n",
      "\n",
      "going on; the camels being sent off in threes and fours, as they\n",
      "\n",
      "were laden, so as to attract no attention. Half an hour later the\n",

      "General came out, and without delay started with the staff, Captain\n",
      "\n",
      "Fitton remaining behind to see that the rest of the stores were\n",
      "\n",
      "sent off, and a small tent for the use of the General. The arrival of the General at Kassinger excited no surprise, as\n",
      "\n",
      "he had ridden over the day before; but when, in the afternoon,\n",
      "\n",
      "orders were issued that the camels should all be laden, in\n",

      "\n",
      "that, at length, their long halt was at an end, and they were to\n",
      "\n",
      "have another chance of getting at the enemy. A large train of camels had been quietly collected at Kassinger,\n",
      "\n",
      "sufficient to carry the necessary supplies for the use of the\n",

      "column, for some three weeks' time; and it was hoped that, before\n",
      "\n",
      "long, the gunboats and many of the native craft, with stores, would\n",
      "\n",
      "join them at Abu Hamed. The distance to be travelled was a\n",
      "\n",
      "hundred and eighteen miles, and the road was a very difficult one. The ground rose steeply, almost from the edge of the river; and at\n",
      "\n",

      "day; but that at night he was to continue his work with the camels;\n",
      "\n",
      "he went back to his tent, and threw himself on his bed. But, in\n",
      "\n",
      "spite of the fly being fastened up, and a blanket thrown over the\n",
      "\n",
      "tent, the heat was so great that he was only able to doze off\n",
      "\n",
      "occasionally. They had erected screens, with their blankets placed end to end,\n",
      "\n",
      "supported by their guns; and lay there, getting what air there was,\n",
      "\n",
      "and sheltered from the direct rays of the sun. There was some argument, among the officers, as to the relative\n",
      "\n",
      "advantages of night and day marches. All agreed that, if only one\n",

      "march in the day, and permit the troops to sleep at night. This\n",
      "\n",
      "opinion certainly seemed to be justified; for, at the end of the\n",

      "that they stumbled as they marched; and were with difficulty\n",
      "\n",
      "restrained from throwing themselves down, to get the much-needed\n",

      "for some other point, was unknown. The people were delighted to see\n",

      "raiding parties. They had heard of the capture of Abu Hamed, by the\n",
      "\n",
      "British, from horsemen who had escaped; but all these had said,\n",
      "\n",
      "confidently, that Mahmud would speedily drive them out again; and\n",

      "through her side, under water, and the water poured in, in volumes. A rush was made by those on board; and beds, pillows, and blankets\n",
      "\n",
      "were stuffed into the hole. \"We shall have to get the guns and stores on shore, to lighten her;\n",

      "that we should know it, for certain. You must push straight on, and\n",

      "do so; if not, seize a boat--there are some at every village--and\n",

      "of their speed; but as they neared Berber, there was a perceptible\n",
      "\n",
      "slackness. Ahmed Bey and Gregory rode backwards and forwards along\n",

      "they retired inland; leaving behind them fourteen large boats,\n",

      "pleasure. \"That is Hilliard, General; the young fellow who jumped from one\n",

      "unnoticed at the time, but a black he had with him was released,\n",

      "wrong. An officer's life is no longer his own, but belongs to the\n",

      "anxious to do all I can to repay the debt.\" They found Mahmud in the usual attitude in which the Dervish emirs\n",

      "either cut the army altogether, or exchange into the Guards.\" The party presently broke up, having finished the last bottle of\n",

      "discussing the chances of the campaign, and the points where\n",

      "\"that a young fellow like this, who seems to be an Egyptian by\n",

      "fifteen or twenty years.\" \"It is because, for the purpose of the war in this country, they\n",

      "\n",
      "that any officer in the army, whatever his rank, would be proud to\n",
      "\n",
      "have done. He went in disguise into the Dervish camp at Metemmeh,\n",

      "\n",
      "at the hands of the Dervishes. In point of fact, his escape was a\n",

      "remarkable one, for he was tied to a tree in the first line of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervish defences at Atbara, and was only saved by what was almost a\n",
      "\n",
      "miracle. He may not be heir to an earldom, Mr. Hartley, but he\n",
      "\n",
      "would do more credit to the title than many I could name. I hear\n",
      "\n",
      "him well spoken of, by everyone, as an indefatigable worker, and as\n",
      "\n",
      "having performed the most valuable services. Captain Keppel, on\n",
      "\n",
      "whose gunboat he served for two or three months, spoke to me of him\n",
      "\n",
      "in the highest terms; and General Hunter has done the same. \"I fancy, sir, that it will be some years before you are likely\n",

      "\n",
      "now does.\" Gregory had walked away when the Major rose, and he did not\n",
      "\n",
      "return to the party. It was the first time that he had run across a\n",
      "\n",
      "bad specimen of the British officer, and his words had stung him. But, as he said to himself, he need not mind them, as the fellow's\n",
      "\n",
      "own comrades regarded him, as one of them said, as \"an insufferable\n",
      "\n",
      "ass.\" Still, he could not help wishing, to himself, that the\n",

      "\n",
      "at nightfall. It began suddenly; there was a flash of lightning, and\n",
      "\n",
      "then came a violent burst of wind, which tore down the tents and\n",

      "the flimsy shelters of the Egyptians and Soudanese. Before this had\n",

      "\n",
      "rain kept on till morning, and when the start was made, everyone\n",

      "the course was winding, and the current ran with great strength,\n",
      "\n",
      "the eddies and sharp bends making it extremely difficult for the\n",

      "the town and Surgham Hill. It was formed in five divisions, each of\n",

      "which was bright with banners of all colours, sizes, and shapes. The Khalifa's own division was in the centre, where his great black\n",

      "\n",
      "as in the forts at Metemmeh and Shabluka, the embrasures were so\n",

      "faultily constructed that the guns could only be brought to bear\n",

      "upon the portion of the river directly facing them, and the four\n",

      "\n",
      "were so able to maintain the bombardment without receiving any fire\n",

      "great excitement in the Dervish lines, and a number of their\n",

      "\n",
      "and these checked the advance of the enemy, until the rest fell\n",
      "\n",
      "back. The news of the advance was signalled to General Kitchener, and\n",

      "\n",
      "Surgham, but the Khalifa apparently considered that it was too late\n",
      "\n",
      "in the day for a general attack, and drew off his men to their\n",
      "\n",
      "former position, and the rest of the afternoon and evening passed\n",
      "\n",
      "quietly. As the men ate their meal, of tinned meat and biscuit,\n",
      "\n",
      "they were in higher spirits than they had been since the advance\n",

      "began. Hitherto, they had been in constant apprehension lest the\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervishes should shun a battle, and would retire across the desert\n",

      "interminable desert marches, only to find, on arriving at the goal,\n",
      "\n",
      "that the enemy had again moved off. The events of the day, however,\n",
      "\n",
      "seemed to show that this fear was groundless, and that the Khalifa\n",

      "had determined to fight a decisive battle for the defence of his\n",
      "\n",
      "capital. The British soldier is ready to support any fatigue, and any\n",
      "\n",
      "hardship, with a prospect of a fight at the end; and, during the\n",
      "\n",
      "advance, he is always haunted by the fear that the enemy will\n",
      "\n",
      "retire, or give in on his approach. This fear was stronger than\n",
      "\n",
      "usual on this expedition, for there was no question as to the\n",
      "\n",
      "greatly superior mobility of the Dervishes; and it was evident\n",
      "\n",
      "that, if they chose to avoid fighting, they had it in their power\n",
      "\n",
      "to do so. The night passed quietly, except that shots were occasionally\n",
      "\n",
      "fired by Dervishes who crept up within range; and that, once, a\n",
      "\n",
      "mounted man, who had apparently lost his way, rode fearlessly into\n",

      "\n",
      "were strict that the camp was not to be alarmed, unless in the case\n",
      "\n",
      "of a serious attack. The animals were watered and fed, and the men had a\n",

      "in the world, and animated by religious fanaticism, and an intense\n",

      "happened. \"One of them, seeing me come along, and observing that I\n",

      "what money I had; for, since I have been in my lord's service, I\n",

      "dollars for his sisters. The black was overpowered with joy and, going off, returned with\n",
      "\n",
      "the two girls--for they were little more. Each took one of\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregory's hands, and pressed it to her forehead and heart, and\n",

      "murmured her thanks. I do not know whether he has told you that\n",

      "he saved my life, at the risk of his own.\" \"I have been thinking, my lord,\" Zaki said, \"that it would be\n",
      "\n",
      "well for them to go down in the boat as far as Dongola. Our village\n",
      "\n",
      "is not many miles from that place, and many of our people fled\n",
      "\n",
      "there; and doubtless they will return to their villages, and plant\n",

      "the river bank, and saw them on board one of the native craft,\n",
      "\n",
      "which carried also fifteen or twenty other fugitives. \"Now, Mr. Hilliard,\" General Hunter said, that morning, \"you can\n",

      "better post than you could hope to get, at home.\" Certainly, when I\n",
      "\n",
      "left Cairo, I had no idea of remaining permanently in the service;\n",

      "\n",
      "am quite determined that, if I can obtain an appointment, I will\n",

      "remain here. I have no ties, whatever, either in Lower Egypt or in\n",

      "supposed that Fadil had joined the Khalifa before the fight at\n",

      "\n",
      "got off in the skirmish, yesterday, carried the news there; and\n",
      "\n",
      "probably some of them would go direct to Fadil, and if he came down\n",
      "\n",
      "upon us here, with his eight thousand men, our position would be a\n",

      "desperate one. It cost us four days to cross the river at El\n",

      "and before that time, he might be upon us. \"It is evident, gentlemen, that we have only the choice of these\n",

      "confidence, as they had defeated the Mahdists who had been\n",

      "she found that he was as determined as his father, and absolutely\n",
      "\n",
      "refused to release her from the engagement, she had given way; and\n",
      "\n",
      "had, after a quiet marriage, accompanied him to London. There he had endeavoured to get literary work, but had found it\n",
      "\n",
      "much harder than he had expected. The market was overcrowded, and\n",
      "\n",
      "they had moved from comfortable lodgings into small rooms; and so,\n",
      "\n",
      "step by step, had come to the attic in Lupus Street. He was doing a\n",
      "\n",
      "little better now, and had hopes that, ere long, he would begin to\n",
      "\n",
      "make his way steadily up. Never very strong, she had\n",
      "\n",
      "developed a short, hard cough; and he had drawn upon his scanty\n",
      "\n",
      "reserves, to consult a specialist. \"If you\n",
      "\n",
      "can manage it, I should say that she ought certainly to be taken to\n",

      "a warm climate. The damage is not extensive, as yet; and it is\n",
      "\n",
      "probable that, under favourable circumstances, she might shake it\n",
      "\n",
      "off; but I fear that, if she continues to live in London, her\n",
      "\n",
      "chances are not great.\" This, Gregory felt, was almost equivalent to a death sentence;\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "some post abroad. When he first read the advertisement that morning, he had hardly\n",

      "idea of becoming a mere messenger; but his wife's cough had decided\n",
      "\n",
      "him. \"I may not get it,\" he said to himself, as he went out; \"but my\n",
      "\n",
      "knowledge of Arabic, and the native dialect, is all in my favour. And at least, in a year or two, she may have thoroughly shaken off\n",
      "\n",
      "the cough, and that is everything. \"At any rate, I have a better chance of getting this than I had\n",
      "\n",
      "of the other places that I applied for. Hilliard will do as well as Hartley;\n",

      "\n",
      "recognize it as my name. \"As for the marquis, as he has never been friendly with us, it\n",

      "\n",
      "saying he wished to speak to Mr. Partridge, at once shown in. A\n",
      "\n",
      "good many of his personal belongings had been long since pledged;\n",
      "\n",
      "but he had retained one or two suits, so that he could make as good\n",
      "\n",
      "an appearance as possible, when he went out. The clerk had merely\n",
      "\n",
      "said, \"A gentleman wishes to speak to you, sir,\" and the merchant\n",

      "\n",
      "said: \"Have you called on your own account?\" \"Yes; I am anxious to go abroad, for the sake of my wife's\n",
      "\n",
      "health, and I am not particular as to what I do, so that I can take\n",
      "\n",
      "her to a warm climate. I may say that I have been two years in\n",
      "\n",
      "Egypt, and speak Arabic and Koptic fluently. I am strong and\n",

      "active, and am ready to make myself useful, in any way.\" Certainly this\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "for the place, in answer to his advertisement. That he was\n",
      "\n",
      "evidently a gentleman was far from an advantage, but the fact that\n",
      "\n",
      "he could speak the languages would add much to his value. I should not like to apply to any of my friends,\n",
      "\n",
      "in such a matter. Were it not for my wife's health, I could earn my living; but I am\n",
      "\n",
      "told it is essential that she should go to a warm climate, and as I\n",
      "\n",
      "see no other way of accomplishing this, I have applied for this\n",
      "\n",
      "situation, hoping that my knowledge of the language, and my\n",
      "\n",
      "readiness to perform whatever duties I may be required to do, might\n",
      "\n",
      "induce you to give me a trial.\" \"And you would, if necessary--say, in the case of illness of one\n",
      "\n",
      "of my clerks--be ready to help in the office?\" He had come to the conclusion that the story he had heard was a\n",
      "\n",
      "true one. He had quarrelled with his family, probably over his\n",
      "\n",
      "marriage; and, as so many had done, found it difficult to keep his\n",
      "\n",
      "head above water. His wife had been ordered to a warm climate, and\n",
      "\n",
      "he was ready to do anything that would enable him to keep her\n",
      "\n",
      "there. It would assuredly be a great advantage to have one who could\n",
      "\n",
      "act, in an emergency, as a clerk; of course, his knowledge of\n",
      "\n",
      "language would greatly add to his utility. It certainly was not\n",
      "\n",
      "business to take a man without a reference, but the advantages more\n",
      "\n",
      "than counterbalanced the disadvantages. It was not likely that he\n",
      "\n",
      "would stay with him long; but at any rate, the fact that he was\n",
      "\n",
      "taking his wife with him would ensure his staying, until he saw\n",
      "\n",
      "something a great deal better elsewhere. I quite believe the story that you have told me, and\n",
      "\n",
      "your appearance fully carries it out. I am willing to pay for a second-class passage for your\n",
      "\n",
      "wife, as well as yourself; and will give such instructions, to my\n",
      "\n",
      "agents there, as will render your position as easy for you as\n",
      "\n",
      "possible. In the natural course of things, your duties would have\n",
      "\n",
      "included the sweeping out of the offices, and work of that\n",
      "\n",
      "description; but I will instruct him to engage a native to do this,\n",
      "\n",
      "under your supervision. You will be in charge of the warehouse,\n",
      "\n",
      "under the chief storekeeper; and, as you say, you will, in case of\n",
      "\n",
      "pressure of work in the office, take a desk there. \"In consideration of your knowledge of the language, which will\n",
      "\n",
      "render you, at once, more useful than a green hand would be, I\n",
      "\n",
      "shall add ten shillings a week to the wages named in the\n",
      "\n",
      "advertisement, which will enable you to obtain comfortable\n",
      "\n",
      "lodgings.\" \"I am heartily obliged to you, sir,\" Gregory said, \"and will do\n",
      "\n",
      "my best to show that your confidence in me has not been misplaced. \"Then in that case I will take a passage, for you and your wife,\n",
      "\n",
      "in the P. and O. that sails, next Thursday, from Southampton. If you will call again in half an hour, I will hand you the ticket\n",
      "\n",
      "and a cheque for that amount; and you can call, the day before you\n",
      "\n",
      "go, for a letter to our agents there.\" Gregory ascended the stairs to his lodging with a far more\n",
      "\n",
      "elastic step than usual. His wife saw at once, as he entered, that\n",
      "\n",
      "he had good news of some sort. I have obtained a situation, at about a hundred and thirty pounds a\n",
      "\n",
      "year, in Alexandria.\" That is one thing; and what is of\n",
      "\n",
      "infinitely more consequence, it is a place that will suit your\n",
      "\n",
      "health; and you will, I hope, very soon get rid of that nasty\n",
      "\n",
      "cough. I did not tell you at the time, but the doctor I took you to\n",
      "\n",
      "said that this London air did not suit you, but that a warm climate\n",
      "\n",
      "would soon set you up again.\" \"I am going to be a sort of useful man--extra clerk, assistant\n",
      "\n",
      "storekeeper, et cetera, et cetera. It will\n",
      "\n",
      "suit me to a T. At any rate, it will be a vast improvement upon\n",
      "\n",
      "this. We sha'n't have to depend upon them as our main\n",
      "\n",
      "staple, in future; for fruit is dirt cheap, out there, and one does\n",
      "\n",
      "not want much meat. We shall be able to live like princes, on two\n",
      "\n",
      "pounds ten a week; and besides, this appointment may lead to\n",
      "\n",
      "something better, and we may consider that there is a future before\n",
      "\n",
      "us. We shall not want much outfit: half a dozen suits of white\n",
      "\n",
      "drill for myself, and some gowns for you.\" You would not let\n",
      "\n",
      "me sell any of my dresses, and I have half a dozen light ones. In the\n",
      "\n",
      "first place, I will go down to that confectioner's, round the\n",
      "\n",
      "corner; and we will celebrate my appointment with a cold chicken,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a bottle of port. We are going out at the best\n",
      "\n",
      "time of the year, and it will be a comfort, indeed, to change these\n",
      "\n",
      "November fogs for the sunshine of Egypt. You will have four or five\n",
      "\n",
      "months to get strong again, before it begins to be hot. Even in\n",
      "\n",
      "summer, there are cool breezes morning and evening; and of course,\n",
      "\n",
      "no one thinks of going out in the middle of the day. I feel as\n",
      "\n",
      "happy as a schoolboy, at the thought of getting out of this den and\n",
      "\n",
      "this miserable climate, and of basking in the sunshine. But it has\n",
      "\n",
      "been a trial, when your manuscripts have come back, to see you\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting here slaving away; and to know that it is I who have\n",
      "\n",
      "brought you to this.\" If a man chooses a path for himself, he must not\n",
      "\n",
      "grumble because he finds it rather rougher than he expected. I have\n",
      "\n",
      "never, for a single moment, regretted what I have done; at any\n",
      "\n",
      "rate, as far as I, myself, am concerned.\" The life of a governess is not so\n",
      "\n",
      "cheerful as to cause one regret, at leaving it.\" And so, Gregory Hartley and his wife went out to Alexandria, and\n",
      "\n",
      "established themselves in three bright rooms, in the upper part of\n",
      "\n",
      "a house that commanded a view of the port, and the sea beyond it. The outlay required for furniture was small, indeed: some matting\n",
      "\n",
      "for the floors, a few cushions for the divans which ran round the\n",
      "\n",
      "rooms, a bed, a few simple cooking utensils, and a small stock of\n",
      "\n",
      "crockery sufficed. Mr. Ferguson, the manager of the branch, had at first read the\n",
      "\n",
      "letter that Gregory had brought him with some doubt in his mind, as\n",
      "\n",
      "to the wisdom of his principal, in sending out a man who was\n",
      "\n",
      "evidently a gentleman. This feeling, however, soon wore away; and\n",
      "\n",
      "he found him perfectly ready to undertake any work to which he was\n",
      "\n",
      "set. He\n",
      "\n",
      "was at the office early, and saw that the native swept and dusted\n",
      "\n",
      "the offices. The rest of the day he was either in the warehouse, or\n",
      "\n",
      "carried messages, and generally did such odd jobs as were required. A fortnight after his arrival, one of the clerks was kept away by a\n",
      "\n",
      "sharp attack of fever; and as work was pressing, the agent asked\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregory to take his place. Mr. Hardman will take Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Parrot's ledgers; and, as you will only have to copy the\n",
      "\n",
      "storekeeper's issues into the books, five minutes will show you the\n",
      "\n",
      "form in which they are entered.\" Gregory gave such satisfaction that he was afterwards employed\n",
      "\n",
      "at office work, whenever there was any pressure. At the end of twelve\n",
      "\n",
      "months, his pay was raised another ten shillings a week. He had, before leaving England, signed a contract to remain with\n",
      "\n",
      "the firm for two years. He regretted having to do this, as it\n",
      "\n",
      "prevented his accepting any better position, should an opening\n",
      "\n",
      "occur; but he recognized that the condition was a fair one, after\n",
      "\n",
      "the firm paying for his outfit and for two passages. \"I don't mind my work a bit,\" he said to his wife, \"but, if only\n",
      "\n",
      "for the sake of the boy\" (a son had been born, a few months after\n",
      "\n",
      "their arrival), \"I must try to raise myself in the scale, a bit. From\n",
      "\n",
      "what the manager said to me the other day, if a vacancy occurred in\n",
      "\n",
      "the office, I should have the offer of the berth. Of course, it\n",
      "\n",
      "would be a step; for I know, from the books, that Hardman gets two\n",
      "\n",
      "hundred a year, which is forty more than I do.\" It troubles\n",
      "\n",
      "me, to think that half your time is spent packing up goods in the\n",
      "\n",
      "warehouse, and work of that sort; and even if we got less I would\n",
      "\n",
      "much rather, even if we had to stint ourselves, that your work was\n",
      "\n",
      "more suitable to your past; and such that you could associate again\n",
      "\n",
      "with gentlemen, on even terms.\" \"That does not trouble me, dear, except that I wish you had some\n",
      "\n",
      "society among ladies. However, both for your sake and the boy's,\n",
      "\n",
      "and I own I should like it myself, I will certainly keep on the\n",
      "\n",
      "lookout for some better position. I have often regretted, now, that\n",
      "\n",
      "I did not go in for a commission in the army. By this time, with luck, I might have\n",
      "\n",
      "got my company; and though the pay would not have been more than I\n",
      "\n",
      "get here, it would, with quarters and so on, have been as much, and\n",
      "\n",
      "we should be in a very different social position. \"However, it is of no use talking about that now; and indeed, it\n",
      "\n",
      "is difficult to make plans at all. Things are in such an unsettled\n",
      "\n",
      "condition, here, that there is no saying what will happen. Tewfik has been obliged to make concession after concession\n",
      "\n",
      "to them, to dismiss ministers at their orders, and to submit to a\n",
      "\n",
      "series of humiliations. At any moment, Arabi could dethrone him, as\n",
      "\n",
      "he has the whole army at his back, and certainly the larger portion\n",
      "\n",
      "of the population. The revolution could be completed without\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble or bloodshed; but you see, it is complicated by the fact\n",
      "\n",
      "that Tewfik has the support of the English and French governments;\n",
      "\n",
      "and there can be little doubt that the populace regard the movement\n",
      "\n",
      "as a national one, and directed as much against foreign control and\n",
      "\n",
      "interference as against Tewfik, against whom they have no ground of\n",
      "\n",
      "complaint, whatever. On the part of the army and its generals, the\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble has arisen solely on account of the favouritism shown to\n",
      "\n",
      "Circassian officers. Attacks have been made upon these in various country\n",
      "\n",
      "districts; and, should Arabi be triumphant, the position of\n",
      "\n",
      "Christians will become very precarious. Matters are evidently seen\n",
      "\n",
      "in that light in England; for I heard today, at the office, that\n",
      "\n",
      "the British and French squadrons are expected here, in a day or\n",
      "\n",
      "two. But I should hardly think that Arabi would venture to\n",
      "\n",
      "try his strength against that of the fleets, and I fancy that\n",
      "\n",
      "trouble will, in the first place, begin in Cairo; both as being the\n",
      "\n",
      "capital of the country, and beyond the reach of armed interference\n",
      "\n",
      "by the Powers. Arabi's natural course would be to consolidate his\n",
      "\n",
      "power throughout the whole of Egypt, leaving Alexandria severely\n",
      "\n",
      "alone, until he had obtained absolute authority elsewhere. \"Anyhow, it will be a satisfaction to have the fleet up; as, at\n",

      "\n",
      "one of the ships lying in harbour. As a simple measure of\n",
      "\n",
      "precaution, I would suggest that you should go out with me, this\n",
      "\n",
      "evening, and buy one of the costumes worn by the native women. It\n",
      "\n",
      "is only a long blue robe, enveloping you from head to foot; and one\n",
      "\n",
      "of those hideous white cotton veils, falling from below the eyes. I\n",
      "\n",
      "will get a bottle of iodine, and you will then only have to darken\n",
      "\n",
      "your forehead and eyelids, and you could pass, unsuspected, through\n",

      "any crowd.\" \"I will get a native dress, too; but you must remember that\n",

      "\n",
      "settled upon them, but he soon found that there was no advantage in\n",
      "\n",
      "this. So he sat quietly in his corner and, like the rest, looked\n",
      "\n",
      "like a dirty white statue. There were occasional stops, when they\n",
      "\n",
      "all got out, shook themselves, and took a few mouthfuls of fresh\n",

      "\n",
      "out a great success; and the meals were eaten in the open air,\n",

      "\n",
      "department, to get their passes for the journey up the Nile, as far\n",
      "\n",
      "as Wady Halfa. The next step was to go down to the river for a swim\n",
      "\n",
      "and, by dint of shaking and beating, to get rid of the accumulated\n",
      "\n",
      "dust. Assouan was not a pleasant place to linger in and, as soon as\n",
      "\n",
      "they had completed their purchases, Captain Ewart and Gregory\n",

      "of stores of all kinds, and rails and sleepers for the railway, and\n",

      "almost unnoticed. It was glorious to think that, in whatever humble\n",

      "tyranny under which it had groaned, to avenge Gordon and Hicks and\n",
      "\n",
      "the gallant men who had died with them! Occasionally, Captain Ewart came up and talked to him, but he\n",
      "\n",
      "was well content to sit on one of the bales, and listen to the\n",
      "\n",
      "conversation without joining in it. In another couple of years he,\n",
      "\n",
      "too, would have had his experiences, and would be able to take his\n",

      "\n",
      "from many chimneys, and the clang of hammers, told that the railway\n",

      "no loss of time in pushing forward supplies to Abu Hamed, as soon\n",
      "\n",
      "as the railway was completed to that point. A few miles have been constructed, and several\n",

      "was a Canadian by birth, and proved, in every respect, equal to the\n",
      "\n",
      "onerous and responsible work to which he was appointed. However, labour was cheap, and railway battalions were raised\n",
      "\n",
      "among the Egyptian peasants, their pay being the same as that of\n",
      "\n",
      "the soldiers. Strong, hearty, and accustomed to labour and a scanty\n",
      "\n",
      "diet, no men could have been more fitted for the work. They\n",
      "\n",
      "preferred it to soldiering; for although, as they had already\n",
      "\n",
      "shown, and were still further to prove, the Egyptian can fight, and\n",
      "\n",
      "fight bravely; he is, by nature, peaceable, and prefers work,\n",

      "Abu Hamed, which was still in the hands of the Dervishes. It had\n",
      "\n",
      "been constructed with extraordinary rapidity, for the ground was so\n",

      "level that only occasional cuttings were needed. The men were divided into gangs, each under\n",
      "\n",
      "a head man, and each having its own special work to do. There were\n",
      "\n",
      "the men who unloaded the trucks, the labourers who did the earth\n",

      "work, and the more skilled hands who levelled it. As fast as the\n",
      "\n",
      "trucks were emptied, gangs of men carried the sleepers forward, and\n",
      "\n",
      "laid them down roughly in position; others followed, and corrected\n",
      "\n",
      "the distance between each. The rails were then brought along and\n",
      "\n",
      "laid down, with the fish plates, in the proper places; men put\n",

      "these on, and boys screwed up the nuts. Then plate layers followed\n",
      "\n",
      "and lined the rails accurately; and, when this was done, sand was\n",
      "\n",
      "thrown in and packed down between the sleepers. By this division of labour, the line was pushed on from one to\n",

      "\n",
      "so as to prevent any bands of Dervishes from dashing suddenly down\n",

      "would be better than taking a man from Cairo.\" \"Quite right; and the fellows one picks up at Cairo are\n",

      "may not know much, but are ready enough to learn; and, if well\n",
      "\n",
      "treated, will go through fire and water for their master. \"Go down to the stores, and tell the officer in charge there\n",

      "\n",
      "whom you may choose a servant.\" When Gregory had given his message, the officer said: \"You had better pick out one for yourself, Mr. Hilliard. Strength and willingness to work are the points I keep my eye upon;\n",

      "\n",
      "not interest me. You had better take a turn among the parties at\n",

      "\n",
      "clearly incapable of doing his share in carrying the heavy bales\n",
      "\n",
      "and boxes, that were easily handled by older men. You do not seem to be strong enough for this\n",

      "\n",
      "try you.\" and, although I try my hardest, I\n",

      "tell me, you can send me back to work here.\" And, followed by the young tribesman, he went to the\n",
      "\n",
      "headquarters camp, near which an empty hut was assigned to him. The roof was of poles, on which were thickly laid boughs and\n",
      "\n",
      "palm leaves; and on these a layer of clay, a foot thick. \"Well, Zaki, the first thing is to clear out all this rubbish,\n",

      "of that sort, from one of the natives here? He then walked down to the river, and found the black corporal\n",
      "\n",
      "sitting tranquilly by the side of his baggage. The man stood up and\n",
      "\n",
      "saluted, and on Gregory saying that he had now a house, at once\n",
      "\n",
      "told off two soldiers to carry the things. Arriving at the hut, he found Zaki hard at work, shovelling the\n",
      "\n",
      "rubbish through the doorway. Just as he came up, the boy brought\n",
      "\n",
      "down his tool, with a crash, upon a little brown creature that was\n",
      "\n",
      "scuttling away. When you have got\n",
      "\n",
      "the rubbish out, make a fire in the middle, wet some leaves and\n",
      "\n",
      "things and put them on, and we will hang a blanket over the window\n",
      "\n",
      "and shut the door. I will moisten some powder and scatter it among\n",
      "\n",
      "the leaves, and the sulphur will help the smoke to bring them\n",

      "down.\" This was done, the door closed and, as it did not fit at all\n",
      "\n",
      "tightly, the cracks were filled with some damp earth from the\n",
      "\n",
      "watercourse. There is a sauce pan and a kettle, so you can boil some rice or fry\n",
      "\n",
      "some meat.\" The troops were in little\n",
      "\n",
      "mud huts, of their own construction; as these, in the heat of the\n",

      "\n",
      "Soudanese troops were all occupied in cooking, mending their\n",
      "\n",
      "clothes, sweeping the streets between the rows of huts, and other\n",
      "\n",
      "light duties. They seemed, to Gregory, as full of fun and life as a\n",
      "\n",
      "party of schoolboys--laughing, joking, and playing practical tricks\n",
      "\n",
      "on each other. The physique of some of the regiments was splendid, the men\n",
      "\n",
      "averaging over six feet in height, and being splendidly built. Other regiments, recruited among different tribes, were not so\n",
      "\n",
      "tall, but their sturdy figures showed them to be capable of any\n",
      "\n",
      "effort they might be called upon to make. \"We have so few\n",

      "are going to move.\" \"I shall be happy to come in and have a chat,\" Gregory said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"but I do not drink anything. I have been brought up in Cairo, and\n",

      "\n",
      "seven miles, so as to be well out of sight of anyone on the\n",
      "\n",
      "hills.\" They waited five minutes, until it died away in the\n",
      "\n",
      "distance, and then continued their course. It was slow work, as\n",
      "\n",
      "they had to avoid every bush carefully; lest, if their pursuers\n",

      "went on ahead; while Gregory led the two horses. They gave the horses a\n",
      "\n",
      "scanty drink, and took a mouthful or two each; and then, throwing\n",
      "\n",
      "themselves down, allowed the horses to crop the scanty herbage. After four hours' halt they pursued their way on foot for three\n",
      "\n",
      "hours, laying their course by the stars. They calculated that they\n",
      "\n",
      "must have gone a good fifteen miles from the point where they\n",
      "\n",
      "turned off, and feared that they might miss the caravan track, if\n",

      "they went on before daybreak. As soon as the sun was up they pursued their journey, Gregory's\n",

      "lord,\" and he pointed to the skeleton of a camel. Looking at the map, I should\n",
      "\n",
      "say that we must be about abreast of the line of Gakdul. This route\n",
      "\n",
      "is only just indicated, and there are no halting places marked upon\n",
      "\n",
      "it. We have about sixty miles farther to go, so that if the horses\n",
      "\n",
      "were fresh we might be there this evening; but as it is, we have\n",
      "\n",
      "still two, if not three days' journey before us. Just let the\n",
      "\n",
      "horses wet their mouths; we can keep on for a bit, before we have a\n",
      "\n",
      "drink. \"Well, we must ride as far as we can and, at any rate, must keep\n",
      "\n",
      "one gourdful for tomorrow. If we cover twenty-five miles today--and\n",
      "\n",
      "I don't think the horses can do more--we can manage, if they are\n",
      "\n",
      "entirely done up, to walk the other thirty-five miles. However, as\n",
      "\n",
      "I said, there must be wells, and even if they are dry, we may be\n",
      "\n",
      "able to scratch the sand out and find a little water. \"That is a poor supply for two days, Zaki, but we must make the\n",
      "\n",
      "best of them. We will only eat a few today, so as to have a fair\n",
      "\n",
      "meal in the morning. We shall want it, if we have to walk\n",
      "\n",
      "thirty-five miles over the sand.\" \"It will not be all sand,\" Zaki said; \"there is grass for the\n",
      "\n",
      "last fifteen miles, near the river; and there were cultivated\n",
      "\n",
      "fields about ten miles out, before the Dervishes came.\" The herbage the horses had cropped during the halt had served,\n",
      "\n",
      "to a certain degree, to supply the place of water; and they\n",
      "\n",
      "proceeded at a brisker pace than Gregory had expected. Even if the wells are dry, you\n",
      "\n",
      "will see a difference in the growth of the bushes round them; and\n",
      "\n",
      "as it is certain that this route has not been used for some time,\n",
      "\n",
      "there may even be grass.\" They rode on at an easy canter, and avoided pressing the horses\n",
      "\n",
      "in the slightest degree, allowing them to walk whenever they chose. \"The bushes look\n",
      "\n",
      "green about here, and the horses have got something of a feed.\" \"I think this must be one of the old halting places,\" Zaki said,\n",
      "\n",
      "looking round as they dismounted. \"We will take the bridles out of\n",
      "\n",
      "the horses' mouths, so that they can chew the leaves up better; and\n",
      "\n",
      "then we will see if we can find where the wells were.\" Two others were discovered, and the sand at the bottom of one of\n",
      "\n",
      "them looked a somewhat darker colour than the others. \"Bring down those two\n",
      "\n",
      "half gourds; they will help us to shovel the sand aside.\" The bottom of the hole was some six feet across, and they set to\n",
      "\n",
      "work in the middle of it. By the time they had got down two feet,\n",
      "\n",
      "the sand was soft and clammy. \"We will get to water, Zaki, if we have to stay here all day!\"\n",
      "\n",
      "said Gregory. It was hard work, and it was not until after four hours' toil\n",
      "\n",
      "that, to their delight, they found the sand wet under their feet. They had taken it by turns to use the scoop, for the labour of\n",
      "\n",
      "making the hole large enough for them both to work at once would\n",
      "\n",
      "have been excessive. Gregory took a gourd, and buried it in the soft soil until the\n",
      "\n",
      "water flowed in over the brim. The scoops were\n",
      "\n",
      "then refilled and carried to the horses, who drank with an\n",
      "\n",
      "eagerness that showed how great was their thirst. This was half filled, and then, exhausted with their work, they\n",
      "\n",
      "threw themselves down and slept for some hours. \"We are safe now, and only have to fear a band of marauding\n",
      "\n",
      "Arabs; and it would be hard luck, were we to fall in with them. \"There is no particular reason for hurry, and even if we miss\n",
      "\n",
      "the trail we know that, by keeping straight on, we shall strike the\n",
      "\n",
      "river somewhere near Korti or Ambukol.\" For an hour they went at a walk, and then the horses broke into\n",
      "\n",
      "their usual pace, of their own accord. It was getting dark, now,\n",
      "\n",
      "and soon even Zaki could not make out the track. \"The horses will keep to it, my lord,\" he said; \"their sight is\n",
      "\n",
      "a great deal better than ours, and I dare say their smell may have\n",
      "\n",
      "something to do with it. Besides, the track is clear of bushes, so\n",
      "\n",
      "we should know at once, if they strayed from it.\" They rode for five hours, and then felt that the horses were\n",
      "\n",
      "beginning to fag. \"We certainly cannot be more\n",
      "\n",
      "than five-and-twenty miles from the river; and, if we start at\n",
      "\n",
      "dawn, shall be there before the heat of the day begins. We can have\n",
      "\n",
      "another handful of dates, and give the horses a handful each, and\n",
      "\n",
      "that will leave us a few for the morning.\" The horses, after being given the dates, were again turned\n",
      "\n",
      "loose; and it was not long before they were heard pulling the\n",
      "\n",
      "leaves off bushes. \"Our case is a good deal better this evening than it was\n",
      "\n",
      "yesterday,\" Gregory said. \"Then it looked as if it would be rather\n",
      "\n",
      "a close thing, for I am sure the horses could not have gone much\n",
      "\n",
      "farther, if we had not found the water. They get little\n",
      "\n",
      "else, when they are with the Arabs; a handful of durra,\n",
      "\n",
      "occasionally, when they are at work; but at other times they only\n",
      "\n",
      "get what they can pick up. They ate the remainder of their dates, took a drink of water,\n",
      "\n",
      "and gave two gourdfuls to the horses; and, in a quarter of an hour,\n",
      "\n",
      "were on their way again. They had ridden but two or three miles,\n",
      "\n",
      "when Zaki exclaimed: \"There are some horsemen!\" As far as I can see, only four of them have guns; the others\n",
      "\n",
      "have spears. With my breech-loader I can fire\n",
      "\n",
      "two shots to their one, and we have pistols, as well.\" The Arabs drew up ahead of them, and remained quiet there until\n",
      "\n",
      "the others came to within fifty yards, and checked their horses. A\n",
      "\n",
      "man who appeared to be the leader of the party shouted the usual\n",
      "\n",
      "salutation, to which Gregory replied. \"For that you will not want guns,\" the man said, \"and we need\n",
      "\n",
      "them badly. Then he said to Zaki, \"Dismount and stand behind your horse, and\n",
      "\n",
      "fire over the saddle; but don't fire the first shot now.\" Scarcely had he done so when\n",
      "\n",
      "four shots were fired, and Gregory took a steady aim at the chief. Zaki did not fire until they were within\n",
      "\n",
      "twenty yards, and directly afterwards Gregory fired again. He then saw why Zaki had not fired when he first did so--his\n",
      "\n",
      "horse was lying dead in front of him, shot through the head. Dismayed at the loss of so\n",
      "\n",
      "many of their number, the three survivors rode off at full\n",
      "\n",
      "speed. That fellow without a spear\n",
      "\n",
      "has got pistols, and fired just as I did; or rather, an instant\n",
      "\n",
      "before. \"Just see if they have got some dates on their saddles,\" for the\n",
      "\n",
      "horses of the fallen men had remained by the side of their masters'\n",
      "\n",
      "bodies. But before we go, we will break the stocks of\n",
      "\n",
      "these four guns, and carry the barrels off, and throw them into the\n",
      "\n",
      "bushes, a mile or two away.\" They halted\n",
      "\n",
      "in a quarter of an hour and, after Gregory's arm had been bound\n",
      "\n",
      "tightly to his side with his sash, both they and their horses had a\n",
      "\n",
      "good meal of dates. There was a slight stir as they were seen coming, and a dozen\n",
      "\n",
      "black soldiers sprang up and ran forward, fixing bayonets as they\n",
      "\n",
      "did so. They knew that the Dervishes were sometimes ready to throw away\n",
      "\n",
      "their own lives, if they could but kill some of their enemy. He went back to the tents, and returned with a white officer,\n",
      "\n",
      "whom Gregory at once recognized as one of those who had come up\n",

      "with him from Wady Halfa. The officer had stopped in astonishment, at hearing this seeming\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervish address him, by name, in English. \"But what are you masquerading for, in this dress; and where\n",

      "\n",
      "for the last three days we have had nothing but dates, and not too\n",

      "up to the tents again, where he was warmly received by the three\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "the garrison at that place was by no means a strong one. The\n",

      "\n",
      "only one brigade, leaving the rest to hold Merawi; and ordered the\n",

      "as far as the Gakdul wells, where their appearance would lead\n",

      "going on; the camels being sent off in threes and fours, as they\n",

      "\n",
      "Fitton remaining behind to see that the rest of the stores were\n",

      "\n",
      "that, at length, their long halt was at an end, and they were to\n",
      "\n",
      "have another chance of getting at the enemy. A large train of camels had been quietly collected at Kassinger,\n",
      "\n",
      "sufficient to carry the necessary supplies for the use of the\n",

      "\n",
      "join them at Abu Hamed. The distance to be travelled was a\n",
      "\n",
      "hundred and eighteen miles, and the road was a very difficult one. The ground rose steeply, almost from the edge of the river; and at\n",
      "\n",

      "day; but that at night he was to continue his work with the camels;\n",
      "\n",
      "he went back to his tent, and threw himself on his bed. But, in\n",
      "\n",
      "spite of the fly being fastened up, and a blanket thrown over the\n",
      "\n",
      "tent, the heat was so great that he was only able to doze off\n",
      "\n",
      "occasionally. They had erected screens, with their blankets placed end to end,\n",
      "\n",
      "supported by their guns; and lay there, getting what air there was,\n",
      "\n",
      "and sheltered from the direct rays of the sun. There was some argument, among the officers, as to the relative\n",

      "advantages of night and day marches. All agreed that, if only one\n",

      "\n",
      "march in the day, and permit the troops to sleep at night. This\n",
      "\n",
      "opinion certainly seemed to be justified; for, at the end of the\n",

      "restrained from throwing themselves down, to get the much-needed\n",

      "\n",
      "halting place, as he did before starting in the evening, to bathe\n",

      "been accomplished in seven days and a half. So far as they knew, the enemy had, as yet, received no news of\n",
      "\n",
      "their approach. Three hours' rest was given the troops, and then\n",
      "\n",
      "they marched out, in order of battle. The desert sloped gradually\n",

      "down to it, on all sides; with a sharp, deep descent within two\n",

      "they could only fire at the tops of the houses; but, changing their\n",

      "\n",

      "\n",
      "starting. The distance to be traversed to Berber was a hundred and\n",

      "thirty miles, and the expedition was undoubtedly a hazardous one. Even if the news was true, that the five thousand Dervishes who had\n",

      "they learned that the report that the Dervishes had left Berber was\n",
      "\n",
      "generally believed; but whether they had marched for Metemmeh, or\n",
      "\n",
      "for some other point, was unknown. The people were delighted to see\n",
      "\n",
      "the gunboat; as, until its arrival, they had been in hourly fear of\n",
      "\n",
      "raiding parties. They had heard of the capture of Abu Hamed, by the\n",
      "\n",
      "British, from horsemen who had escaped; but all these had said,\n",
      "\n",
      "confidently, that Mahmud would speedily drive them out again; and\n",
      "\n",
      "they had been in hourly fear that the Dervishes would swoop down\n",
      "\n",
      "upon them, and carry off the few possessions still remaining to\n",
      "\n",
      "them. When within thirty miles of Berber the Arabs had halted on the\n",

      "bank, watching the gunboat as, with great difficulty, it made its\n",

      "way up a cataract. \"I am afraid she has,\" said Gregory; who had, all along, ridden\n",

      "by his side at the head of the party. A hole had been knocked\n",
      "\n",
      "through her side, under water, and the water poured in, in volumes. A rush was made by those on board; and beds, pillows, and blankets\n",
      "\n",
      "were stuffed into the hole. \"We shall have to get the guns and stores on shore, to lighten her;\n",
      "\n",
      "and then heel her over, to get at the hole. It will certainly take\n",
      "\n",
      "two or three days; by that time, I hope, the other gunboat will be\n",

      "up. I think there can be\n",
      "\n",
      "no doubt that the Dervishes have all left, but it is most important\n",
      "\n",
      "that we should know it, for certain. You must push straight on, and\n",
      "\n",
      "as soon as you arrive there, send word on to me by the fastest\n",
      "\n",
      "camel you have. Take up a position close to the river, and hold it\n",
      "\n",
      "until you are relieved. If you can send off news to me by a camel,\n",
      "\n",
      "do so; if not, seize a boat--there are some at every village--and\n",
      "\n",
      "send the news down by water. \"I will do as you order,\" the sheik said; \"and if you see us no\n",
      "\n",
      "more, you will know that we died as brave men.\" \"You will defend yourselves as brave men if you are attacked, I am\n",
      "\n",
      "sure; but as I am convinced that the Dervishes have left Berber, I\n",
      "\n",
      "think there is little fear of your falling in with them.\" They are less likely to get nervous, if they are riding hard,\n",
      "\n",
      "than they would be if they dawdled along. The sheik rejoined his band, which gathered round to hear the\n",
      "\n",
      "result of his interview with the white general. \"The steamer is injured,\" he said, \"but she will soon be made\n",
      "\n",
      "right, and will follow us. We are to have the honour of going on\n",
      "\n",
      "and occupying Berber, and will show ourselves worthy of it. If we meet them\n",
      "\n",
      "we will fight; and you, Abu, who have the fastest camel among us,\n",
      "\n",
      "will ride back here at all speed, and the General and his soldiers\n",
      "\n",
      "will come up to help us. In five hours\n",
      "\n",
      "we shall be at Berber; and throughout your lives, you will be proud\n",
      "\n",
      "to say that you were the first to enter the town that the Dervishes\n",
      "\n",
      "have so long held.\" \"Look here,\" he said, \"if we see the Dervishes coming in force,\n",
      "\n",
      "I shall come to you, at once. I shall give you a note for the General, and you will\n",
      "\n",
      "ride back at full gallop, and give it to him. The horse is fast,\n",
      "\n",
      "and there will be no fear of their catching you, even if they\n",
      "\n",
      "chase; which they will not be likely to do, as they will be\n",
      "\n",
      "thinking of attacking us.\" I will do as you order me, but I would\n",
      "\n",
      "rather stop and fight, by your side.\" There was no talking along\n",
      "\n",
      "the line, every man had his rifle unslung and in his hand, every\n",
      "\n",
      "eye scanned the country. Hitherto, they had had unlimited faith in\n",
      "\n",
      "the power of the gunboat to protect them; now that they might have\n",
      "\n",
      "to face the Dervishes unaided, they felt the danger a serious one. They had come to fight the Dervishes, and were ready to do so, in\n",
      "\n",
      "anything like equal numbers; but the force they might meet would\n",
      "\n",
      "possibly be greatly stronger than their own--so strong that,\n",
      "\n",
      "although they might sell their lives dearly; they would, in the\n",
      "\n",
      "end, be overpowered. For the first three hours, the camels were kept going at the top\n",
      "\n",
      "of their speed; but as they neared Berber, there was a perceptible\n",
      "\n",
      "slackness. Ahmed Bey and Gregory rode backwards and forwards along\n",
      "\n",
      "the line, keeping them together, and encouraging them. Do you think that they\n",
      "\n",
      "would have remained so long in the town, if they had learned that\n",
      "\n",
      "there are but two hundred of us, and one steamer? Mahmud would\n",
      "\n",
      "never have forgiven them, had they not fallen upon us and\n",
      "\n",
      "annihilated us. It will add to our glory, to have won a battle, as well as\n",
      "\n",
      "taken the town. Your\n",
      "\n",
      "women will be proud of you, and the men of the black regiments will\n",
      "\n",
      "say that we have shown ourselves to be as brave as they are. \"We will halt for half an hour, rest the camels, and then push\n",

      "on at full speed again; but mind, you have my orders: if you should\n",

      "\n",
      "we have but to keep calm, and shoot straight, and we need not fear\n",
      "\n",
      "the Dervishes, however many of them there may be.\" Gregory saw, with\n",
      "\n",
      "pleasure, that the Arabs were now thoroughly wound up to fighting\n",

      "point. The same vigilant watch was kept up as before; but the air\n",
      "\n",
      "of gloom that had hung over them, when they first started, had now\n",
      "\n",
      "disappeared; each man was ready to fight to the last. As the town\n",
      "\n",
      "was seen, the tension was at its highest; but the pace quickened,\n",
      "\n",
      "rather than relaxed. If, in five minutes, they do not appear;\n",
      "\n",
      "it will be because they have all gone.\" But there were no signs of the enemy, no clouds of dust rising\n",
      "\n",
      "in the town, that would tell of a hasty gathering. The women looked timidly from the\n",
      "\n",
      "windows; and then, on seeing that their robes did not bear the\n",
      "\n",
      "black patches worn by the Dervishes, they broke into loud cries of\n",
      "\n",
      "welcome. The sheik waved his rifle over his head; and his followers burst\n",
      "\n",
      "into loud shouts of triumph, and pressed on, firing their muskets\n",
      "\n",
      "in the air. The Arabs kept on, till they reached the\n",
      "\n",
      "house formerly occupied by the Egyptian governor. It is not likely that the Dervishes will return, but it is as well\n",
      "\n",
      "to be prepared. The house is strong, and we could hold out here\n",
      "\n",
      "against a host, unless they were provided with cannon. \"I have money, and you had better buy up as much food as\n",
      "\n",
      "possible, so that we could stand a siege for some time. I shall\n",
      "\n",
      "give my horse a good feed and an hour's rest, and then send my man\n",
      "\n",
      "down to the General, telling him that the Dervishes have deserted\n",
      "\n",
      "the town, and that we have taken possession of the place, and can\n",
      "\n",
      "defend it for a long time should they return.\" The\n",
      "\n",
      "inhabitants, finding that they would be paid, brought out their\n",
      "\n",
      "hidden stores; and by evening, enough was collected to last the\n",
      "\n",
      "garrison ten days. Zaki returned at noon next day, with a letter from General\n",
      "\n",
      "Hunter to the sheik, praising him highly for the energy and courage\n",
      "\n",
      "of his men and himself. He also brought a note for Gregory, saying\n",
      "\n",
      "that he hoped to get the repairs finished the next day; and that he\n",
      "\n",
      "expected, by that time, the other two steamers would be up, when he\n",
      "\n",
      "should at once advance to Berber. On the third day the smoke of the steamers was seen in the\n",
      "\n",
      "distance; and an hour later the gunboats arrived, and were greeted\n",
      "\n",
      "with cries of welcome by the natives, who thronged the bank. \"It was a dangerous\n",

      "\n",
      "I should not have ventured to send you forward. I shall leave you still in possession of it, but I do not\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "until the railway is finished to Abu Hamed, I can only get up\n",
      "\n",
      "stores sufficient for the men here; certainly we have no transport\n",
      "\n",
      "that could keep up the supply for the whole force. However, all\n",
      "\n",
      "this will be settled by the Sirdar, who will very shortly be with\n",
      "\n",
      "us.\" It was now the 6th of September and, the same afternoon, two\n",
      "\n",
      "gunboats were sent up to Ed Damer, an important position lying a\n",
      "\n",
      "mile or two beyond the junction of Atbara river with the Nile. On\n",
      "\n",
      "the opposite bank of the Nile, they found encamped the Dervishes\n",
      "\n",
      "who had retired from Berber. The guns opened fire upon them, and\n",
      "\n",
      "they retired inland; leaving behind them fourteen large boats,\n",
      "\n",
      "laden with grain. These were at once sent down to Berber, where\n",
      "\n",
      "they were most welcome; and a portion of the grain was distributed\n",
      "\n",
      "among the almost starving population, nearly five thousand in\n",
      "\n",
      "number, principally women and children. Supplies soon began to arrive from below, being brought up in\n",
      "\n",
      "native craft, from Abu Hamed, as far as the cataract; then unloaded\n",
      "\n",
      "and carried up past the rapids on camels; then again placed in\n",
      "\n",
      "boats, and so brought to Berber. Macdonald's brigade started a\n",
      "\n",
      "fortnight after the occupation, their place at Abu Hamed having\n",
      "\n",
      "been taken by a brigade from Kassinger, each battalion having towed\n",
      "\n",
      "up boats carrying two months' supply of provisions. A fort was now erected at the junction of the two rivers, and\n",
      "\n",
      "occupied by a small force, under an English officer. Two small\n",
      "\n",
      "steamers were employed in towing the native craft from Abu Hamed to\n",
      "\n",
      "Berber. Still, it was evident that it would be impossible to\n",
      "\n",
      "accumulate the necessary stores for the whole force that would take\n",
      "\n",
      "the field; accordingly, as soon as the railway reached Abu Hamed,\n",
      "\n",
      "the Sirdar ordered it to be carried on as far as Berber. He himself\n",
      "\n",
      "came up with Colonel Wingate, the head of the Intelligence\n",
      "\n",
      "Department; and, diligently as all had worked before, their\n",
      "\n",
      "exertions were now redoubled. On the morning after the Sirdar's arrival, an orderly came\n",
      "\n",
      "across to General Hunter's quarters, with a request that Mr.\n",
      "\n",
      "Hilliard should at once be sent to headquarters. Gregory had to\n",
      "\n",
      "wait nearly half an hour, until the officers who had been there\n",
      "\n",
      "before him had had their audience, and received their orders. I certainly did not expect, when I saw you a few months ago in\n",
      "\n",
      "Cairo, that you would so speedily distinguish yourself. I was then\n",
      "\n",
      "struck with your manner, and thought that you would do well, and\n",
      "\n",
      "you have much more than fulfilled my expectations. I shall keep my\n",
      "\n",
      "eye upon you, and shall see that you have every opportunity of\n",
      "\n",
      "continuing as you have begun.\" That evening, General Hunter suggested to Colonel Wingate that\n",

      "aside the expedition he undertook to Metemmeh, he is a most zealous\n",

      "great for their old brass guns. Most of the shot fell short, though\n",

      "\n",
      "shrapnel, committing terrible havoc on the forts, whose fire\n",

      "past them, the enemy were unable to bring a gun to bear upon the\n",

      "unnecessary to widen the embrasures, so that the guns could fire\n",

      "\n",
      "Soudanese fired volleys, and their rash assailants went at once\n",
      "\n",
      "into the thicker bush, many dropping before they gained it. The gunboats now steamed slowly up the river; and then, turning,\n",
      "\n",
      "retired downstream again, shelling the enemy's position as they\n",
      "\n",
      "passed. As they were going down they came upon a number of\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervishes, who were busy unloading half a dozen native craft. The\n",
      "\n",
      "Maxim soon sent them flying; and the boats, which contained horses,\n",

      "donkeys, grain, and other goods, were taken in tow by the gunboats,\n",

      "direct. The black gunners are well trained, and know their work;\n",
      "\n",
      "still, if by any chance the gun jams, it will be useful for you to\n",
      "\n",
      "be able to show them what to do; even though they know it as well\n",
      "\n",
      "as, or better than, you do yourself. The blacks like being\n",

      "inserted in every paper. \"After a lapse of five years Mr. Hartley's father, who was the\n",

      "\n",
      "decided that twenty-one years must elapse before such an\n",

      "your personal advantage, and a title, would be able to command the\n",

      "American market, and to pick up an heiress with millions.\" The general laugh that followed showed that Hartley was, by no\n",
      "\n",
      "means, a popular character in the regiment. No\n",
      "\n",
      "one believes that he had anything the matter with him, at Cairo;\n",
      "\n",
      "but he preferred stopping behind and coming up by himself, without\n",
      "\n",
      "any duties, to taking any share in the work. He is always talking\n",
      "\n",
      "about his earldom--that is why the Major mentioned it, so as to\n",
      "\n",
      "draw him out.\" For aught that is known, there\n",
      "\n",
      "may be half a dozen children of the man that is missing, knocking\n",
      "\n",
      "about somewhere in Canada or Australia. You see, as the man had an elder brother,\n",
      "\n",
      "he would not have counted at all upon coming to the title. He may\n",
      "\n",
      "be in some out-of-the-way place, where even a colonial newspaper\n",
      "\n",
      "would never reach him; but, sooner or later, he or some of his sons\n",
      "\n",
      "will be coming home, and will hear of the last earl's death, and\n",

      "then this fellow's nose will be put out of joint. \"I am sure everyone in the regiment would be glad, for he is an\n",

      "insufferable ass. I suppose, when he comes into the title, he will\n",
      "\n",
      "either cut the army altogether, or exchange into the Guards.\" The party presently broke up, having finished the last bottle of\n",
      "\n",
      "wine they had brought up. Gregory remained seated by the Major,\n",
      "\n",
      "discussing the chances of the campaign, and the points where\n",
      "\n",
      "resistance might be expected. Presently Gregory caught the words: \"How is it that this young fellow calls himself Bimbashi, which,\n",
      "\n",
      "I believe, means major?\" All\n",
      "\n",
      "the white officers in the Egyptian Army have that rank, though they\n",
      "\n",
      "may only be lieutenants, in ours.\" \"I call it a monstrous thing,\" the drawling voice then said,\n",
      "\n",
      "\"that a young fellow like this, who seems to be an Egyptian by\n",
      "\n",
      "birth, should have a higher rank than men here, who have served\n",
      "\n",
      "fifteen or twenty years.\" \"It is because, for the purpose of the war in this country, they\n",
      "\n",
      "know infinitely more than the officers of our army. As for Mr. Hilliard, he has performed feats\n",
      "\n",
      "that any officer in the army, whatever his rank, would be proud to\n",
      "\n",
      "have done. He went in disguise into the Dervish camp at Metemmeh,\n",
      "\n",
      "before Hunter's advance began, and obtained invaluable information. He jumped overboard from a gunboat to save a drowning Dervish\n",
      "\n",
      "woman, although to do so involved almost certain capture and death\n",
      "\n",
      "at the hands of the Dervishes. In point of fact, his escape was a\n",
      "\n",
      "remarkable one, for he was tied to a tree in the first line of the\n",
      "\n",
      "Dervish defences at Atbara, and was only saved by what was almost a\n",
      "\n",
      "miracle. He may not be heir to an earldom, Mr. Hartley, but he\n",
      "\n",
      "would do more credit to the title than many I could name. I hear\n",
      "\n",
      "him well spoken of, by everyone, as an indefatigable worker, and as\n",
      "\n",
      "having performed the most valuable services. Captain Keppel, on\n",
      "\n",
      "whose gunboat he served for two or three months, spoke to me of him\n",
      "\n",
      "in the highest terms; and General Hunter has done the same. \"I fancy, sir, that it will be some years before you are likely\n",
      "\n",
      "to distinguish yourself so highly. His father was an officer, who\n",
      "\n",
      "fell in battle; and if he happened to be born in Egypt, as you\n",
      "\n",
      "sneeringly said just now, all I can say is that, in my opinion, had\n",
      "\n",
      "you been born in Egypt, you would not occupy the position which he\n",
      "\n",
      "now does.\" Gregory had walked away when the Major rose, and he did not\n",
      "\n",
      "return to the party. It was the first time that he had run across a\n",
      "\n",
      "bad specimen of the British officer, and his words had stung him. But, as he said to himself, he need not mind them, as the fellow's\n",
      "\n",
      "own comrades regarded him, as one of them said, as \"an insufferable\n",
      "\n",
      "ass.\" Still, he could not help wishing, to himself, that the\n",
      "\n",
      "missing heir might turn up in time to disappoint him. General Hunter started next day, at noon, with two of his\n",
      "\n",
      "brigades and the mounted troops; the other two brigades following,\n",
      "\n",
      "at nightfall. It began suddenly; there was a flash of lightning, and\n",
      "\n",
      "then came a violent burst of wind, which tore down the tents and\n",
      "\n",
      "the flimsy shelters of the Egyptians and Soudanese. Before this had\n",
      "\n",
      "ceased, the rain poured down in a torrent; lightning, wind, and\n",
      "\n",
      "rain kept on till morning, and when the start was made, everyone\n",
      "\n",
      "was soaked to the skin. Here it had been expected that the advance would be opposed, as\n",
      "\n",
      "strong forts had been erected by the enemy, the river narrowed\n",
      "\n",
      "greatly, and precipitous rocks rose on either side. Through these\n",
      "\n",
      "the course was winding, and the current ran with great strength,\n",
      "\n",
      "the eddies and sharp bends making it extremely difficult for the\n",
      "\n",
      "gunboats to keep their course. Indeed, it would have been\n",
      "\n",
      "impossible for them to get up, had the forts been manned; as they\n",
      "\n",
      "would have had to pass within two hundred yards of the guns. But\n",
      "\n",
      "although the forts could hardly have been attacked by the gunboats,\n",
      "\n",
      "they were commanded by a lofty hill behind them; and the scouts had\n",
      "\n",
      "discovered, some weeks before, that the Dervishes had retired from\n",
      "\n",
      "the position, and that the passage would be unopposed. Maxwell's and Colville's brigades started at four that\n",

      "off, went up in a gunboat, starting at nine in the morning. As usual, the Soudanese troops had been accompanied by a\n",
      "\n",
      "considerable number of their wives, who were heavily laden with\n",
      "\n",
      "their little household goods, and in many cases babies. They\n",
      "\n",
      "trudged patiently along in the rear of the columns, and formed an\n",

      "\n",
      "selecting a piece of ground surrounded by thick bush, into which\n",

      "they could escape, should Dervish raiders come down upon them. One of the gunboats, however,\n",

      "was missing--the Zafir, with three gyasses in tow, having suddenly\n",
      "\n",
      "sunk, ten miles north of Shendy, owing to being so deeply loaded\n",
      "\n",
      "that the water got into the hold. Those on board had just time to\n",

      "scramble into the boats, or swim to shore. Fortunately,\n",
      "\n",

      "generally. The Sirdar, therefore, did not discourage their presence\n",
      "\n",
      "in the field, and even supplied them with rations, when it was\n",
      "\n",
      "impossible for them to obtain them elsewhere. At\n",
      "\n",
      "nine o'clock they arrived at their camping ground, and the whole\n",
      "\n",
      "army was again collected together. Next morning the four squadrons\n",
      "\n",
      "of Egyptian horse, with a portion of the cavalry, went forward to\n",
      "\n",
      "reconnoitre, and one of the gunboats proceeded a few miles up the\n",
      "\n",
      "river. This had ceased at\n",

      "daybreak, and a strong wind speedily dried the sands, raising such\n",

      "clouds of dust that it was difficult to see above a few yards. On the other side of the river, Stuart-Wortley's friendlies had\n",

      "\n",
      "a village, whose inhabitants had not obeyed the Khalifa's orders to\n",

      "move into Omdurman. As the rainstorms continued, it was decided, by a council of\n",

      "to encounter the Khalifa's attack, but arrived without molestation\n",
      "\n",
      "at Um Teref, a short distance from Kerreri, where it was expected\n",
      "\n",
      "the enemy would give battle. The camp was smaller than those hitherto made, and was protected\n",
      "\n",
      "by a strong zareba. The tents had been left behind, and as the little blanket\n",

      "\n",
      "the Dervish patrols, but the latter, although numerous, avoided\n",

      "spies, in Dervish attire. He had left Omdurman thirty hours before,\n",
      "\n",
      "and brought the news that the Khalifa intended to attack at\n",
      "\n",

      "old prophecy, by a Persian sheik, to the effect that English\n",

      "soldiers would one day fight at Kerreri, and be destroyed there. It\n",

      "was called the death place of all the infidels; and, once a year,\n",
      "\n",
      "the Khalifa and his followers made a pilgrimage to it. A few shots were fired during the night, and fires blazed on the\n",

      "hills to notify, to Omdurman, our precise position. The troops\n",
      "\n",
      "started again soon after daylight, facing now to the right and\n",
      "\n",
      "marching westward, to leave the bush and broken ground, and get out\n",
      "\n",
      "in the open desert, stretching away to Omdurman. The cavalry were\n",
      "\n",
      "widely spread out, and the Lancers ascended to the top of the hill\n",

      "beyond the range of the four gunboats that steamed quietly up. After a short march the force halted near the river, two miles\n",

      "great excitement in the Dervish lines, and a number of their\n",

      "the whole force at once took their position, in fighting order. Believing that a general attack on the camp would now be made, the\n",

      "Dervishes should shun a battle, and would retire across the desert\n",

      "that the enemy had again moved off. The events of the day, however,\n",

      "\n",
      "retire, or give in on his approach. This fear was stronger than\n",
      "\n",
      "usual on this expedition, for there was no question as to the\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "that, if they chose to avoid fighting, they had it in their power\n",
      "\n",
      "to do so. The night passed quietly, except that shots were occasionally\n",

      "happened. \"One of them, seeing me come along, and observing that I\n",

      "what money I had; for, since I have been in my lord's service, I\n",

      "will give me an order, for them, to go in one of the boats.\" Several of the native boats, that had already landed their stores,\n",
      "\n",
      "would leave on the following day; and Gregory obtained an order for\n",
      "\n",
      "the passage of the two women. He then drew some money from the\n",
      "\n",
      "paymaster and, on his return to headquarters, gave Zaki a hundred\n",

      "dollars for his sisters. The black was overpowered with joy and, going off, returned with\n",
      "\n",
      "the two girls--for they were little more. Each took one of\n",
      "\n",
      "Gregory's hands, and pressed it to her forehead and heart, and\n",
      "\n",
      "murmured her thanks. I do not know whether he has told you that\n",
      "\n",
      "he saved my life, at the risk of his own.\" \"I have been thinking, my lord,\" Zaki said, \"that it would be\n",
      "\n",
      "well for them to go down in the boat as far as Dongola. Our village\n",
      "\n",
      "is not many miles from that place, and many of our people fled\n",
      "\n",
      "there; and doubtless they will return to their villages, and plant\n",
      "\n",
      "their fields, now that they have no longer any fear of the\n",

      "Dervishes. I shall be very glad to know that you will\n",
      "\n",
      "have a home to go to, when this war is quite over.\" \"I shall never go, as long as my lord will keep me,\" Zaki said,\n",

      "fervently. \"I certainly shall not part with you, Zaki, as long as I remain\n",
      "\n",
      "in this country, which will probably be for a long time.\" The next day, Zaki aided in carrying his sisters' goods down to\n",
      "\n",
      "the river bank, and saw them on board one of the native craft,\n",
      "\n",
      "which carried also fifteen or twenty other fugitives. \"Now, Mr. Hilliard,\" General Hunter said, that morning, \"you can\n",
      "\n",
      "devote yourself to the object for which you came here. Of course, I don't know what your plans may be;\n",
      "\n",
      "but unless you have a very good reason to the contrary, I should\n",
      "\n",
      "certainly advise you to retain your position in the Egyptian army. A great deal of work will have to be done, before matters are quite\n",
      "\n",
      "settled down; and then civil administration of some sort will, of\n",
      "\n",
      "course, be formed, under which you would certainly obtain a far\n",
      "\n",
      "better post than you could hope to get, at home.\" Certainly, when I\n",
      "\n",
      "left Cairo, I had no idea of remaining permanently in the service;\n",
      "\n",
      "but I have been so exceptionally fortunate, owing largely to your\n",
      "\n",
      "kindness, that I have been seriously thinking the matter over; and\n",
      "\n",
      "am quite determined that, if I can obtain an appointment, I will\n",
      "\n",
      "remain here. I have no ties, whatever, either in Lower Egypt or in\n",
      "\n",
      "England; no way of earning my living there; and possibly, as I have\n",
      "\n",
      "begun so early, I may rest, in time, in what will no doubt become\n",
      "\n",
      "an important branch of the Egyptian administration.\" We all grumble at\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "it; and there can be no doubt whatever that, under our\n",
      "\n",
      "administration, it will, in time, become a magnificently rich and\n",
      "\n",
      "fertile province.\" Being relieved from other duty, at present, Gregory went to the\n",
      "\n",
      "great yard near the mosque, called the Praying Square, where the\n",
      "\n",
      "majority of the Dervish prisoners were confined. Addressing a man\n",
      "\n",
      "of some five-and-forty years, he asked him, in Arabic, whether many\n",
      "\n",
      "among the prisoners had fought against Hicks, at El Obeid. \"I am not asking on the part of the Sirdar,\" Gregory said; \"and\n",
      "\n",
      "you may be sure that, if no punishment is inflicted against those\n",
      "\n",
      "who have fought against us now, there can be no thought of\n",
      "\n",
      "punishment, for a thing that happened so many years ago. My father\n",
      "\n",
      "was, I believe, one of the English officers killed there; but as he\n",
      "\n",
      "spoke Arabic well, it is just possible he was not killed; but, like\n",
      "\n",
      "Slatin and Neufeld, was kept as a slave, in case he might be\n",
      "\n",
      "useful.\" \"I myself fought there, and nearly all the Baggara who are as old\n",

      "as I am were there, also. When we broke into the square, the English General\n",
      "\n",
      "and his officers charged into the middle of us, and all fell. I was\n",
      "\n",
      "not close at the time, but I saw their bodies, an hour\n",
      "\n",
      "afterwards.\" When the attack by your\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "held together, and marched away, and that there was a white officer\n",
      "\n",
      "with them.\" They\n",
      "\n",
      "fought hard; and at last, when we had lost many men, we offered\n",
      "\n",
      "that, if they would surrender and become the Mahdi's men, they\n",
      "\n",
      "would be spared. Most of them did so, just as some of our\n",

      "\n",
      "would be far safer for you to defend it than to be attacked in the\n",

      "supposed that Fadil had joined the Khalifa before the fight at\n",

      "probably some of them would go direct to Fadil, and if he came down\n",
      "\n",
      "upon us here, with his eight thousand men, our position would be a\n",
      "\n",
      "desperate one. It cost us four days to cross the river at El\n",

      "and before that time, he might be upon us. \"It is evident, gentlemen, that we have only the choice of these\n",

      "confidence, as they had defeated the Mahdists who had been\n",

      "and picked off several of the most determined of their assailants. The fight, however, was too unequal; the Dervishes got in behind\n",

      "\n",
      "the most defensible positions. None of the British officers had been wounded, but fifty-one of\n",

      "the men had been killed, and eighty wounded. Not a moment was lost in preparing for defence, for it was\n",

      "\n",
      "there. A hundred yards away was another enclosure, with a five-foot\n",
      "\n",
      "wall, and two hundred yards away a smaller one. The Arab battalion\n",
      "\n",
      "was stationed to the rear of this, in a square enclosure with a\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "four buildings were so placed, that the fire from each covered the\n",
      "\n",
      "approaches to the other. Two hundred yards from the well enclosure\n",
      "\n",
      "was a fortified house, surrounded by a high wall. As the latter\n",
      "\n",
      "would need too many men for its defence, the wall was pulled down,\n",
      "\n",
      "and a detachment placed in the house. The whole force was at once employed in\n",
      "\n",
      "pulling down huts, clearing the ground of the high grass, and\n",
      "\n",
      "forming a zareba round the town. A large proportion of that carried in the pouches had\n",

      "Parsons, with a small force, hurried back to Mugatta to fetch up\n",

      "Fadil's army, on their return. The ammunition arrived just in time; for, on the following\n",
      "\n",
      "morning, Captain Ruthven's camel men brought in news that Fadil was\n",
      "\n",
      "close at hand. At half-past eight the Dervishes began the attack,\n",
      "\n",
      "on three sides of the defences. Sheltered by the long grass, they\n",
      "\n",
      "were able to make their way to within three hundred yards of the\n",
      "\n",
      "dwellings occupied by the troops. But the intervening ground had\n",
      "\n",
      "all been cleared, and though time after time they made rushes\n",
      "\n",
      "forward, they were unable to withstand the withering fire to which\n",
      "\n",
      "they were exposed. After an hour's vain efforts their musketry fire ceased; but,\n",
      "\n",
      "half an hour later, strong reinforcements came up, and the attack\n",
      "\n",
      "recommenced. This was accompanied with no greater success than the\n",
      "\n",
      "first attack, and Fadil retired to a palm grove, two miles away. For two days, Fadil endeavoured to persuade his troops to make\n",
      "\n",
      "another attack; but although they surrounded the town, and\n",
      "\n",
      "maintained a scattered fire, they could not be brought to attempt\n",

      "another assault, having lost over five hundred men in the two\n",

      "attacks the first day. Three days later, Colonel Parsons said to Gregory: \"I think the time has come, Mr. Hilliard, when I must apply for\n",
      "\n",
      "reinforcements. I am convinced that we can repel all attacks, but\n",
      "\n",
      "we are virtually prisoners here. Our men have behaved admirably;\n",
      "\n",
      "but it is one thing to fight well, when you are advancing; and\n",
      "\n",
      "another to be firm in retreat. Already, the\n",
      "\n",
      "stink of the unburied bodies of the Dervishes is overpowering, and\n",
      "\n",
      "every day it will become worse. Doctor Fleming reports to me that he\n",
      "\n",
      "has a great many sick on his hands, and that he fears the\n",

      "conditions that surround us will bring about an epidemic. Therefore\n",
      "\n",
      "I have decided to send to General Rundle, for a reinforcement that\n",
      "\n",
      "will enable us to move out to attack Fadil.\" You had better pick out a couple of good donkeys,\n",
      "\n",
      "from those we captured here. As it is only nine o'clock, you will\n",
      "\n",
      "be able to get to Mugatta this evening. I don't think there is any\n",
      "\n",
      "fear of your being interfered with, by the Dervishes. We may be\n",
      "\n",
      "sure that Fadil is not allowing his men to roam over the country,\n",
      "\n",
      "for there can be little doubt that a good many of them would\n",
      "\n",
      "desert, as soon as they got fairly beyond his camp.\" \"I don't think there is any fear of that, sir; and as my camels\n",
      "\n",
      "will have had ten days' rest, I should have very little fear of\n",
      "\n",
      "being overtaken, even if they did sight us.\" \"We will go down to the\n",
      "\n",
      "yard where the animals we captured are kept, and choose a couple of\n",
      "\n",
      "good donkeys. I am to carry a despatch to Omdurman, and as time is\n",
      "\n",
      "precious, we will make a straight line across the desert; it will\n",

      "they were at Omdurman, when we went in there.\" An hour later they started, and arrived at Mugatta at eight\n",

      "\n",
      "left had taken good care of them; and, after rewarding him and\n",
      "\n",
      "taking a meal, Gregory determined to start at once. The stars were\n",
      "\n",
      "bright, and there was quite light enough for the camels to\n",
      "\n",
      "travel. They had\n",
      "\n",
      "brought with them sufficient food for four days' travel, and a sack\n",

      "of grain for the camels. \"We will follow the river bank, till we get past the country\n",
      "\n",
      "where the bushes are so thick, and then strike west by north. I\n",
      "\n",
      "saw, by Colonel Parsons' map, that that is about the line we should\n",
      "\n",
      "take.\" They left the river before they reached El Fasher, and continued\n",
      "\n",
      "their journey all night, and onward till the sun was well up. Then\n",
      "\n",
      "they watered the camels (they had, this time, brought with them a\n",
      "\n",
      "large half gourd for the purpose), ate a good meal themselves; and,\n",
      "\n",
      "after placing two piles of grain before the camels, lay down and\n",
      "\n",
      "slept until five o'clock in the afternoon. I have kept our course rather to\n",
      "\n",
      "the west of the direct line, on purpose. I believe the compass is right, and I have\n",
      "\n",
      "struck a match every hour to look at it; but a very slight\n",
      "\n",
      "deviation would make a big difference, at the end of a hundred and\n",
      "\n",
      "fifty miles.\" They rode steadily on, and day was just breaking when he\n",
      "\n",
      "exclaimed: \"There are some buildings opposite. Soon after six o'clock, they rode down to the river bank\n",
      "\n",
      "opposite the town; and, in answer to their signals, a large native\n",
      "\n",
      "boat was rowed across to them. After some trouble the camels were\n",
      "\n",
      "got on board, and in a quarter of an hour they landed. General Rundle had not yet gone out, and on Gregory sending in\n",
      "\n",
      "his name, he was at once admitted. \"I am\n",
      "\n",
      "heartily glad to see you, for it was a very hazardous mission that\n",
      "\n",
      "you undertook. Before reading the long report, the General said, \"Tell me, in a\n",

      "few words, what happened.\" Four days later, Fadil\n",
      "\n",
      "came up with his army and attacked the town; but was driven off,\n",

      "with a loss of five hundred men. The place is unhealthy and, although it can be defended,\n",
      "\n",
      "Colonel Parsons has asked for reinforcements, to enable him to\n",
      "\n",

      "\n",
      "for there was no doubt that Colonel Parsons' force was wholly\n",
      "\n",
      "inadequate for the purpose. \"We started at eleven o'clock in the morning, sir, and rode on\n",
      "\n",

      "eight, and started an hour later on the camels. We rode till nine\n",

      "\n",
      "the town at night, we should have difficulty in getting across the\n",
      "\n",
      "river.\" Gregory enjoyed his breakfast, with the luxuries of tinned\n",
      "\n",
      "fruit, after his rough fare for the past fortnight. When he went to\n",
      "\n",
      "the General's room again, the latter said: \"Colonel Parsons' despatches are very full, and I think I quite\n",

      "thirty-four soldiers of the camel corps. Returning to his hut, Gregory found that Zaki had already got\n",

      "\n",
      "boil the kettle. Go to one of those\n",
